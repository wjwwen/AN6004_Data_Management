With the Neo4j APOC kit and RDBMS JDBC driver .jar file installed into $NEO4J_HOME\plugins\, we may load the Refinitiv Eikon data from a relational database by running a query: 
CALL apoc.load.jdbc('jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/proddb1?user=root&password=huatchye888', “Bloomberg”) YIELD row
RETURN CurrencyExchange, Inflation, GeopoliticalTension, Natural Disaster, FuelPrice, InterestRates

Alternatively, a CSV file can also be loaded manually: 
 LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///Bloomberg.csv" AS row WITH row.CurrencyExchange AS CurrencyExchange, row.Inflation AS Inflation, row.Conflicts AS GeopoliticalTension, row.Disaster AS NaturalDisaster, row.FuelPrice AS FuelPrice, row.InterestRates AS InterestRates RETURN CurrencyExchange, Inflation, GeopoliticalTension, NaturalDisaster, FuelPrice, InterestRates

To create the relationships for analysis:
CREATE (mkp:Person { name: "MktPrice" }),
(eca:Person { name: "CurrencyExchange", data: ""}),
(ecb:Person { name: "Inflation", data: ""}),
(ecc:Person { name: "GeopoliticalTension", source: "US-Iran", data: ""}),
(ecd:Person { name: "NaturalDisaster", type: "snow", country: "Australia", data: ""}),
(ece:Person { name: "FuelPrice", type: "oil", source: "Saudi Arabia", data: ""}),
(ecf:Person { name: "InterestRates", source: "United States", data: ""}),
(eca)-[:INFLUENCES {since: 2020}]->(mkp),
(ecb)-[:INFLUENCES {since: 2022}]->(mkp),
(ecc)-[:INFLUENCES {since: 2021}]->(mkp),
(ecd)-[:INFLUENCES {since: 2022}]->(mkp),
(ece)-[:INFLUENCES {date: "Jan-2020"}]->(mkp),
(ecc)-[:INFLUENCES ]->(eca),
(ecb)-[:INFLUENCES ]->(eca),
(ecf)-[:INFLUENCES ]->(eca)
